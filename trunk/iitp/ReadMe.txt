Catch me @ mobione.pl

Usage:
iitp [-p physfirst]

Value of physfirst is expected to be in hex. You can type it both as 0x1234abcd or 1234abcd.
If physfirst is not given, it will search for the romhdr.bin file and decode it into ROMHDR.txt

Thanks go to globalbus for the help and to c_shekhar for pushing me to make this little tool :=)
